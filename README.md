# Deep-Learning-Coursera (5 Course Deep Learning Specialization)

This repository is for the assignments of Coursera Deep Learning Specialization

## Building your deep learning neural network step by step 

* This folder contains all the steps which go into building a shallow neural network from scratch

## Deep neural network application_Image classification 

* This folder contains the implementation of a deep neural network for an image classification problem - to identify whether it is a cat or non-cat

## Face Recognition

* This folder has the implementation of the famous facenet neural network to solve a face recognition problem on a small sample set of 12 images

## Emojify

* This folder contains the implementation of a text classification problem done using word_2_vec (Glove word vectors) and LSTM to classify the text into 5 different labels which represent different emojis. This model has been trained with just 127 samples to train which shows that LSTMs can be effective even with the small datasets
